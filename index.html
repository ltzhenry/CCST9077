            <h2>Act One: Quantum Superposition and Temporal Dilemma</h2>
            
            <p>[Scene: Inside the dimly lit castle of the Prince of Denmark. Hamlet stands alone, the whispers of his father's ghost echoing around him.]</p>
        
            <p><strong>Hamlet:</strong> (Soliloquy) To be or not to be—that is the question... Revenge or forgiveness? I feel as though I am in a state of quantum superposition, one side called by my father's voice, the other paralyzed by my own fears. I am like Schrödinger's cat, both alive and dead, oscillating between revenge and forgiveness, waiting for something to "measure" me...</p>
        
            <p>[Suddenly, the ghost appears in the far corner of the room, his voice low and urgent.]</p>
        
            <p><strong>Ghost:</strong> (Whispering) Hamlet, my son... Revenge... Revenge is the mission you must undertake.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Hamlet:</strong> (Turning around in shock) Father! Is it really you? Is this real, or merely a figment of my imagination?</p>
        
            <p><strong>Ghost:</strong> (Resolute) Claudius. He killed me and took my throne. You must reveal the truth and make him pay for his crimes.</p>
        
            <p>[Hamlet falls to his knees, his inner pain and anger slowly coming to the surface.]</p>
        
            <p><strong>Hamlet:</strong> (Agitated) Revenge... How am I to exact revenge? Where does this path lead? I feel time twisting around me, as though everything is being pulled into a black hole—past and future intertwined. How am I to find the answer in this distorted fabric of time?</p>
        
            <p><strong>Ghost:</strong> (Gradually fading) Trust yourself, Hamlet. Revenge is the only way...</p>
        
            <p>[The ghost vanishes. Hamlet stands lost in thought. Strange temporal distortions begin to appear in the room; the hands of the clock on the wall speed up and slow down erratically.]</p>
        
            <p><strong>Hamlet:</strong> (Murmuring) Time, that elusive enemy... Perhaps this castle is more than just my home—it is a lost node of time itself. Every room, every tick of the clock seems to change. All I can do is find the precise moment to collapse the wave function of fate to one definitive outcome.</p>
        
            <p>[The lights slowly dim, ending Act One.]</p>
